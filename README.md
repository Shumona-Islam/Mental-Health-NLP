Due to the rise in mental health problems and the demand for efficient medical care, machine learning has been looked into as a potential solution for mental health disorders. This research presents analysis on how mental health disorders can be detected through Natural Language Processing (NLP). With the help of NLP sentiment analysis, we could analyze human emotions through the data provided on social networks and can come to conclusions that will help people who are suffering from mental illness and thus help in correct treatment. Currently our project aims to detect 5 types of mental illness such as Anxiety, Depression, PTSD, Social-anxiety and Suicidal thoughts. In this study we have used five machine learning techniques, one deep learning model and assessed their accuracy in identifying mental health issues using several accuracy criteria. The ml techniques are Random Forest, Linear SVC, Naive bayes, Logistic Regression, XGB. We have compared these techniques and implemented them and also obtained the highest accuracy with Logistic regression technique which is 79.3%. 
We did preprocessing such as tokenization, stopword removal, punctuation removal etc. but, the accuracy was increased when we skipped the preprocessing. So, we kept the preprocessing part for last.
