(maybe more than once)  2) kid gains a new understanding of what love really is, or at least what it isnt and maybe gains a better idea of what they want in a partner.  3) this may happen a few more times into adulthood, but theyre finally at a point where they may have found someone they choose to settle with. cool, but of course no matter what, issues still occur, and recurr with any relationship.  4) why any of this at all?  a different example:  1) guy grows up in poverty  2) all of those years in poverty gave him this crazy drive to make tons of money and live a life he never had.  3) he finally has a big house, nice car, and things hes always wanted. and in my mind, im like ok.. i just went through absolute hell to have these things.. what now?. which leads me to number 4..  4) why any if that at all?  \\nthe way i break down these experiences in my little 1-4 format may be flawed, 3 and 4 to me are related and can overlap, but anyway..  4 is the main one for me, its just kind of the classic why are we even here? question. ok so you learn these lessons in life and eventually find happiness. ok, for what? like ultimately what are we even doing here? are we here just to experience things in these little fleshy suits we have on? why? how does what we experience in our lives here tie into any signifigance into anything at all?  so the combination of the sometimes unbearable pain it takes to finally experience happiness, and not seeing the point of any of it in the first place, makes me not want to live anymore.  im not the best at writing/typing, im also not the best at explaining things, but i tried my best to get this off my chest. thanks to any that took the time to read.</td>\n",

       "1     help with anxiety-inducing fears about school caused by a health issue i'm 35 and planning to go back to grad school, but over the years i developed some eye floaters that i can mostly ignore. they are just out of my visible sight range when reading small books like novels, but i started studying for the gre with a big textbook and realized how obvious these floaters were now, and they've left me with anxiety about how i'm going to cope with school if, on top of everything else like how i'm no longer used to student life, how grad school is likely the hardest form of school i've ever done etc, add to that this problem with distracting floaters in my eyes that distract and annoy me.  i really don't know how to deal here. i am not confident in exposure therapy as i have had these floaters for a few years and really only learned to deal with them by changing my lifestyle such that i don't have to deal with them. it's not a big issue, and some junk in my eyes shouldn't be that much of a problem. but just now i just glanced at my book for a few minutes and now i'm dizzy with worry about it.  what to do?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "2     use up what's left and throw the rest away i recently returned from 6 years working overseas.  unfortunately in the last few years my drinking and stimulant became worse and was detrimental to my mental and physical health.  i'm doing fine now as far as that is concerned. attended therapy, clean and sober since november last year.  when i came back i heard a few of my \"friends\" use the following phrase,  \"we'll just use up what's left of him and then throw the rest away\"  i've never heard this before. i've always been a people pleasing personality type and i'm struggling hard to determine how to interpret it.  maybe i just don't want to face facts that it means exactly what it says... that by hanging around with these people i put myself in a weak position and they aren't real friends at all.  any thoughts?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "4     does anyone else feel like the worst person ever if they annoy a friend? hey reddit. basically, i have mild anxiety. but something that really messes with my head is when i have a fall out or get a blunt text from a friend to say i annoyed them when i did something. my first response is always i'm sorry (and trying not to say it a million times over) but my mind then goes through this turmoil where i have all these esteem lowering thoughts along the lines of, they'll hate me forever now, or i'm such a horrible person, as well as being filled with guilt for upsetting the person.\\nit always turns out that whatever i did wrong only annoyed them for a short period of time and before i knew it life is back to normal, i just wish i could control the horrible negative wave that comes over me                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "8326  am i not understanding/seeing something? this is not a cry for help, this is not me asking for prayers and sympathy, id like this to be more of an intellectual discussion.  what im about to say is coming from a point of view that im aware may be negative and skewed due to events/observations that conditioned my subconscious to think this way.   anyway, i genuinely just dont see the point of this life. to me, it seems very high pain-low/mediocre reward.   in just about every situation, there are 4 things that usually happen with experiences you have, goals you have and just life in general that i have a problem with. that being:  1) the necessary hard-ships/lessons you endure in life.  2) the reward you get out of it.  3) was the reward even worth it?  4) why any of it at all?  number 4 falls into more if a philosophical discussion, but still contributes to why i have suicidal thoughts. i think the 4 above points apply to literally everything, but ill throw out a couple of examples in the format of those points to help illustrate my issue.  1) a young kid gets his/her heart crushed in high school by a girl/boy. (maybe more than once)  2) kid gains a new understanding of what love really is, or at least what it isnt and maybe gains a better idea of what they want in a partner.  3) this may happen a few more times into adulthood, but theyre finally at a point where they may have found someone they choose to settle with. cool, but of course no matter what, issues still occur, and recurr with any relationship.  4) why any of this at all?  a different example:  1) guy grows up in poverty  2) all of those years in poverty gave him this crazy drive to make tons of money and live a life he never had.  3) he finally has a big house, nice car, and things hes always wanted. and in my mind, im like ok.. i just went through absolute hell to have these things.. what now?. which leads me to number 4..  4) why any if that at all?  \\nthe way i break down these experiences in my little 1-4 format may be flawed, 3 and 4 to me are related and can overlap, but anyway..  4 is the main one for me, its just kind of the classic why are we even here? question. ok so you learn these lessons in life and eventually find happiness. ok, for what? like ultimately what are we even doing here? are we here just to experience things in these little fleshy suits we have on? why? how does what we experience in our lives here tie into any signifigance into anything at all?  so the combination of the sometimes unbearable pain it takes to finally experience happiness, and not seeing the point of any of it in the first place, makes me not want to live anymore.  im not the best at writing/typing, im also not the best at explaining things, but i tried my best to get this off my chest. thanks to any that took the time to read.   \n",

       "8329  fuck i've been wanting to kill myself for about 20 years now.  everything i do just makes me think about it more no matter how much i might be lying to myself about enjoying \"the moment\".  i trust no one when it comes to this as basically everyone i've ever opened up to about this has just called the police and the night ends w me naked in solitary confinement.  my plan has been for the last couple years to wait for my parents to die so they don't have to deal with it but i'm leaning closer and closer to saying fuck it to that.  i have a sister but she has a family and they would be essentially unaffected by my absence. i'm willing to hire someone to kill me at this point because i'm pretty sure i'm just too cowardly a piece of shit to do it myself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

(maybe more than once)  2) kid gains a new understanding of what love really is, or at least what it isnt and maybe gains a better idea of what they want in a partner.  3) this may happen a few more times into adulthood, but theyre finally at a point where they may have found someone they choose to settle with. cool, but of course no matter what, issues still occur, and recurr with any relationship.  4) why any of this at all?  a different example:  1) guy grows up in poverty  2) all of those years in poverty gave him this crazy drive to make tons of money and live a life he never had.  3) he finally has a big house, nice car, and things hes always wanted. and in my mind, im like ok.. i just went through absolute hell to have these things.. what now?. which leads me to number 4..  4) why any if that at all?  \\nthe way i break down these experiences in my little 1-4 format may be flawed, 3 and 4 to me are related and can overlap, but anyway..  4 is the main one for me, its just kind of the classic why are we even here? question. ok so you learn these lessons in life and eventually find happiness. ok, for what? like ultimately what are we even doing here? are we here just to experience things in these little fleshy suits we have on? why? how does what we experience in our lives here tie into any signifigance into anything at all?  so the combination of the sometimes unbearable pain it takes to finally experience happiness, and not seeing the point of any of it in the first place, makes me not want to live anymore.  im not the best at writing/typing, im also not the best at explaining things, but i tried my best to get this off my chest. thanks to any that took the time to read.</td>\n",

       "1     help with anxiety-inducing fears about school caused by a health issue i'm 35 and planning to go back to grad school, but over the years i developed some eye floaters that i can mostly ignore. they are just out of my visible sight range when reading small books like novels, but i started studying for the gre with a big textbook and realized how obvious these floaters were now, and they've left me with anxiety about how i'm going to cope with school if, on top of everything else like how i'm no longer used to student life, how grad school is likely the hardest form of school i've ever done etc, add to that this problem with distracting floaters in my eyes that distract and annoy me.  i really don't know how to deal here. i am not confident in exposure therapy as i have had these floaters for a few years and really only learned to deal with them by changing my lifestyle such that i don't have to deal with them. it's not a big issue, and some junk in my eyes shouldn't be that much of a problem. but just now i just glanced at my book for a few minutes and now i'm dizzy with worry about it.  what to do?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "2     use up what's left and throw the rest away i recently returned from 6 years working overseas.  unfortunately in the last few years my drinking and stimulant became worse and was detrimental to my mental and physical health.  i'm doing fine now as far as that is concerned. attended therapy, clean and sober since november last year.  when i came back i heard a few of my \"friends\" use the following phrase,  \"we'll just use up what's left of him and then throw the rest away\"  i've never heard this before. i've always been a people pleasing personality type and i'm struggling hard to determine how to interpret it.  maybe i just don't want to face facts that it means exactly what it says... that by hanging around with these people i put myself in a weak position and they aren't real friends at all.  any thoughts?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "4     does anyone else feel like the worst person ever if they annoy a friend? hey reddit. basically, i have mild anxiety. but something that really messes with my head is when i have a fall out or get a blunt text from a friend to say i annoyed them when i did something. my first response is always i'm sorry (and trying not to say it a million times over) but my mind then goes through this turmoil where i have all these esteem lowering thoughts along the lines of, they'll hate me forever now, or i'm such a horrible person, as well as being filled with guilt for upsetting the person.\\nit always turns out that whatever i did wrong only annoyed them for a short period of time and before i knew it life is back to normal, i just wish i could control the horrible negative wave that comes over me                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "8326  am i not understanding/seeing something? this is not a cry for help, this is not me asking for prayers and sympathy, id like this to be more of an intellectual discussion.  what im about to say is coming from a point of view that im aware may be negative and skewed due to events/observations that conditioned my subconscious to think this way.   anyway, i genuinely just dont see the point of this life. to me, it seems very high pain-low/mediocre reward.   in just about every situation, there are 4 things that usually happen with experiences you have, goals you have and just life in general that i have a problem with. that being:  1) the necessary hard-ships/lessons you endure in life.  2) the reward you get out of it.  3) was the reward even worth it?  4) why any of it at all?  number 4 falls into more if a philosophical discussion, but still contributes to why i have suicidal thoughts. i think the 4 above points apply to literally everything, but ill throw out a couple of examples in the format of those points to help illustrate my issue.  1) a young kid gets his/her heart crushed in high school by a girl/boy. (maybe more than once)  2) kid gains a new understanding of what love really is, or at least what it isnt and maybe gains a better idea of what they want in a partner.  3) this may happen a few more times into adulthood, but theyre finally at a point where they may have found someone they choose to settle with. cool, but of course no matter what, issues still occur, and recurr with any relationship.  4) why any of this at all?  a different example:  1) guy grows up in poverty  2) all of those years in poverty gave him this crazy drive to make tons of money and live a life he never had.  3) he finally has a big house, nice car, and things hes always wanted. and in my mind, im like ok.. i just went through absolute hell to have these things.. what now?. which leads me to number 4..  4) why any if that at all?  \\nthe way i break down these experiences in my little 1-4 format may be flawed, 3 and 4 to me are related and can overlap, but anyway..  4 is the main one for me, its just kind of the classic why are we even here? question. ok so you learn these lessons in life and eventually find happiness. ok, for what? like ultimately what are we even doing here? are we here just to experience things in these little fleshy suits we have on? why? how does what we experience in our lives here tie into any signifigance into anything at all?  so the combination of the sometimes unbearable pain it takes to finally experience happiness, and not seeing the point of any of it in the first place, makes me not want to live anymore.  im not the best at writing/typing, im also not the best at explaining things, but i tried my best to get this off my chest. thanks to any that took the time to read.   \n",

       "8329  fuck i've been wanting to kill myself for about 20 years now.  everything i do just makes me think about it more no matter how much i might be lying to myself about enjoying \"the moment\".  i trust no one when it comes to this as basically everyone i've ever opened up to about this has just called the police and the night ends w me naked in solitary confinement.  my plan has been for the last couple years to wait for my parents to die so they don't have to deal with it but i'm leaning closer and closer to saying fuck it to that.  i have a sister but she has a family and they would be essentially unaffected by my absence. i'm willing to hire someone to kill me at this point because i'm pretty sure i'm just too cowardly a piece of shit to do it myself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "1     help with anxiety-inducing fears about school caused by a health issue i'm 35 and planning to go back to grad school, but over the years i developed some eye floaters that i can mostly ignore. they are just out of my visible sight range when reading small books like novels, but i started studying for the gre with a big textbook and realized how obvious these floaters were now, and they've left me with anxiety about how i'm going to cope with school if, on top of everything else like how i'm no longer used to student life, how grad school is likely the hardest form of school i've ever done etc, add to that this problem with distracting floaters in my eyes that distract and annoy me.  i really don't know how to deal here. i am not confident in exposure therapy as i have had these floaters for a few years and really only learned to deal with them by changing my lifestyle such that i don't have to deal with them. it's not a big issue, and some junk in my eyes shouldn't be that much of a problem. but just now i just glanced at my book for a few minutes and now i'm dizzy with worry about it.  what to do?   \n",
       "2     use up what's left and throw the rest away i recently returned from 6 years working overseas.  unfortunately in the last few years my drinking and stimulant became worse and was detrimental to my mental and physical health.  i'm doing fine now as far as that is concerned. attended therapy, clean and sober since november last year.  when i came back i heard a few of my \"friends\" use the following phrase,  \"we'll just use up what's left of him and then throw the rest away\"  i've never heard this before. i've always been a people pleasing personality type and i'm struggling hard to determine how to interpret it.  maybe i just don't want to face facts that it means exactly what it says... that by hanging around with these people i put myself in a weak position and they aren't real friends at all.  any thoughts?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "4     does anyone else feel like the worst person ever if they annoy a friend? hey reddit. basically, i have mild anxiety. but something that really messes with my head is when i have a fall out or get a blunt text from a friend to say i annoyed them when i did something. my first response is always i'm sorry (and trying not to say it a million times over) but my mind then goes through this turmoil where i have all these esteem lowering thoughts along the lines of, they'll hate me forever now, or i'm such a horrible person, as well as being filled with guilt for upsetting the person.\\nit always turns out that whatever i did wrong only annoyed them for a short period of time and before i knew it life is back to normal, i just wish i could control the horrible negative wave that comes over me                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "1     help with anxiety-inducing fears about school caused by a health issue i'm 35 and planning to go back to grad school, but over the years i developed some eye floaters that i can mostly ignore. they are just out of my visible sight range when reading small books like novels, but i started studying for the gre with a big textbook and realized how obvious these floaters were now, and they've left me with anxiety about how i'm going to cope with school if, on top of everything else like how i'm no longer used to student life, how grad school is likely the hardest form of school i've ever done etc, add to that this problem with distracting floaters in my eyes that distract and annoy me.  i really don't know how to deal here. i am not confident in exposure therapy as i have had these floaters for a few years and really only learned to deal with them by changing my lifestyle such that i don't have to deal with them. it's not a big issue, and some junk in my eyes shouldn't be that much of a problem. but just now i just glanced at my book for a few minutes and now i'm dizzy with worry about it.  what to do?   \n",
       "2     use up what's left and throw the rest away i recently returned from 6 years working overseas.  unfortunately in the last few years my drinking and stimulant became worse and was detrimental to my mental and physical health.  i'm doing fine now as far as that is concerned. attended therapy, clean and sober since november last year.  when i came back i heard a few of my \"friends\" use the following phrase,  \"we'll just use up what's left of him and then throw the rest away\"  i've never heard this before. i've always been a people pleasing personality type and i'm struggling hard to determine how to interpret it.  maybe i just don't want to face facts that it means exactly what it says... that by hanging around with these people i put myself in a weak position and they aren't real friends at all.  any thoughts?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "1     help with anxiety-inducing fears about school caused by a health issue i'm 35 and planning to go back to grad school, but over the years i developed some eye floaters that i can mostly ignore. they are just out of my visible sight range when reading small books like novels, but i started studying for the gre with a big textbook and realized how obvious these floaters were now, and they've left me with anxiety about how i'm going to cope with school if, on top of everything else like how i'm no longer used to student life, how grad school is likely the hardest form of school i've ever done etc, add to that this problem with distracting floaters in my eyes that distract and annoy me.  i really don't know how to deal here. i am not confident in exposure therapy as i have had these floaters for a few years and really only learned to deal with them by changing my lifestyle such that i don't have to deal with them. it's not a big issue, and some junk in my eyes shouldn't be that much of a problem. but just now i just glanced at my book for a few minutes and now i'm dizzy with worry about it.  what to do?   \n",
       "2     use up what's left and throw the rest away i recently returned from 6 years working overseas.  unfortunately in the last few years my drinking and stimulant became worse and was detrimental to my mental and physical health.  i'm doing fine now as far as that is concerned. attended therapy, clean and sober since november last year.  when i came back i heard a few of my \"friends\" use the following phrase,  \"we'll just use up what's left of him and then throw the rest away\"  i've never heard this before. i've always been a people pleasing personality type and i'm struggling hard to determine how to interpret it.  maybe i just don't want to face facts that it means exactly what it says... that by hanging around with these people i put myself in a weak position and they aren't real friends at all.  any thoughts?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "4     does anyone else feel like the worst person ever if they annoy a friend? hey reddit. basically, i have mild anxiety. but something that really messes with my head is when i have a fall out or get a blunt text from a friend to say i annoyed them when i did something. my first response is always i'm sorry (and trying not to say it a million times over) but my mind then goes through this turmoil where i have all these esteem lowering thoughts along the lines of, they'll hate me forever now, or i'm such a horrible person, as well as being filled with guilt for upsetting the person.\\nit always turns out that whatever i did wrong only annoyed them for a short period of time and before i knew it life is back to normal, i just wish i could control the horrible negative wave that comes over me                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
